This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Process (FROM ISYE 3770 10/26):
A. Clean Outliers (farther than 1.5 * IQR)
1. Run box+whisker
2. Remove outliers
3. Run box+whisker

B. Correlations
1. Find Mean, Median, Mode, Range, SDev
2. Run cor.test (when p < .05: SS result) 
  

```{r}
# local copy
my_cars_copy <- cars
# boxplot call 1
boxplot(my_cars_copy$dist)
# find iqr
iqr <- IQR(my_cars_copy$dist)

lower_bound <- quantile(my_cars_copy$dist)[2] - 1.5 * iqr
upper_bound <- quantile(my_cars_copy$dist)[4] + 1.5 * iqr

# Remove outliers
my_cars_copy <- my_cars_copy[my_cars_copy$dist >= lower_bound & my_cars_copy$dist <= upper_bound, ]

boxplot(my_cars_copy$dist)

```

```{r}

plot(cars)
mean(cars$speed)
median(cars$speed)
range(cars$speed)
sqrt(var(cars$speed))

cor.test(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
